                    <h1><center>A gender breakdown of London Borough Councils</center></h1>
                    <p class="lead"><strong><em> Gender issues have dominated the news agenda in recent months - whether the story has been about sexual assault, the gender pay gap, or women in business. But what about local politics? 
                    </em></strong></p>
                    <p> New research has revealed that in the capital, 39% of councillors are women. 
                    </br> </br>
                    The data, from an analysis of local council websites, shows that there are 762 female councillors, compared to 1197 men, in London.  
                    </br></br>
                    Yet although this demonstrates that men dominate the capital’s politics, the figure is above the national average.            
                    </p> 
                    </br>
                    <div id="pie" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto"></div>
                    </br>
                    <p> A Fawcett Society report in 2017 found that just 33% of councillors in the UK were women. This represents just a 5% increase in female representation since 1997, leading the report to conclude that “local government is still, overwhelmingly, a man-made male-dominated world.”
                    </br></br> 
                    Furthermore in the UK Parliament, just 32% of MPs elected in 2017, itself a record year, were female. Currently, the UK is 40th in the world for female representation.
                    </br></br> 
                    The London figures do, however, show a wide disparity in female representation across the capital’s councils. 
                    </br></br> 
                    Lambeth Council has the most female councillors, with 48% of the council women. In contrast, Havering Council has the fewest - only a quarter are female. 
                    </p></br></br>

                    </br></br>
                    <p>Frances Scott from 50:50 Parliament, an organisation campaigning for gender balance at Westminster, said that that the figures were positive but "more needs to be done".
                    </br></br>
                    "It is good to see that women are participating in local councils. 50:50 would like better representation of women at a local level and think that it is important that all our democratic processes and political institutions are equally accessible and inclusive of women.
                    </br></br>
                    <blockquote><center> "But the statistics still reveal the historic, institutional sexism and it is clear that more needs to be done." </center></blockquote>
                    </br> 
                    <p> "Local politics is one route to Westminster so it is great to see women participating, and being able to participate, at a local level. But the statistics still reveal the historic, institutional sexism and it is clear that more needs to be done." 
                     </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p> There is also a large variation in the number of female councillors according to political party. Labour has the most women, with 42% of their councillors female. Of Liberal Democrat councillors, 39% are women, while 33% of Conservatives are female.

                     <p> The Labour Party spokesman said in a statement that "we are committed to increasing the representation of women and under-represented groups in Parliament and at every level of politics."
                     <br/><br/>
                     The spokesman emphasised what the party are doing at a Parliamentary level: "We are proud to have more women and BAME than all of the other political parties put together, and proud of our action to tackle the under-representation of women in Parliament, including changing the law to allow political parties to use All-Women Shortlists to select parliamentary candidates."
                     <br/><br/>
                     The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats declined to comment on the figures. </p>
